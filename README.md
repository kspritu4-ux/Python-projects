***Python Assignments and Data Analysis Projects***
**Overview**

This repository is a collection of Python assignments and mini-projects demonstrating core programming concepts, data analysis, data visualization, and basic machine learning techniques. It is designed to showcase hands-on practice using popular Python libraries.

**Topics Covered**

Python basics (variables, conditionals, loops)

Data manipulation using Pandas and NumPy

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn

Basic machine learning using scikit-learn
